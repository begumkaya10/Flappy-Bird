 Flappy Bird Game

A simple implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using C#. This project showcases basic game mechanics, including gravity, collision detection, and scoring.

 Features

- **Gravity and Jump Mechanics:** The bird moves down due to gravity and can jump when the spacebar is pressed.
- **Pipes and Scoring:** Randomly generated pipes for the bird to navigate through. The score increases as the player successfully passes through the pipes.
- **Game Over Handling:** Displays a game over message and allows the player to restart the game by pressing 'R'.

 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FlappyBirdGame.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Visual Studio.

3. Build and run the project.

 Controls

- **Spacebar:** Make the bird jump.
- **R:** Restart the game after a game over.

 Gameplay

- The objective of the game is to navigate the bird through the pipes without colliding with them or the ground. Each successful pass through the pipes increases the score.
